# Grants

We recommend that your initial step should be to start a [Raffle](https://ergoraffle.com/). A Raffle provides a clear funding goal, shows community support - and can be topped up by grant/foundation funding. 

There are several grant programmes available for larger-scale projects. Submit a grant request directly to the [Good Whale Fund](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/13), [DarkFund0](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/1) - or email us directly at the [team@ergoplatform.org](mailto:team@ergoplatform.org).
