## Are you looking for regional managers? 

If you're interested in starting a regional branch - this can involve running regional chats, hosting meet-ups, etc. 

Check [our chats](https://linktr.ee/ergoplatform) to ensure a branch doesn't already exist for your region. 

While there are several paid community managers within the ergo ecosystem, they are usually promoted from within. If this is somewhere you excel, get involved with the ecosystem, keep on top of new products launching and make yourself useful in a budding project.
