# Sigmanauts

As laid out in the Ergo Manifesto, Ergo was designed for the everyday person. It's a response to centralized banking powers and the weaponization of money. The future of Ergo is in the hands of its users. Alex Chepurnoy, also known as Kushti, encourages everyone to take control of the Ergo ecosystem as much as possible.

But how do you take control of the Ergo ecosystem? As a blockchain, Ergo has the potential to bring out the best in humanity, and its community is quickly becoming one of its greatest strengths. This is why we created the Sigmanauts Program, a grassroots initiative designed to empower people to take ownership of Ergo and help shape its future.

The Sigmanauts Program is all about community participation and contribution. Every individual has something valuable to offer the Ergo ecosystem. What are your strengths? What unique skills do you have to offer? With the Sigmanauts Program, you can make a meaningful impact on the future of finance.

As a member of the Sigmanauts program, you will have the opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals who share our passion for financial privacy and decentralization. Through our training program, you will gain the skills and knowledge needed to contribute to developing the Ergo ecosystem and help shape the future of decentralized finance.

We've identified three categories of participation: Growth, Community, and Creative. The Growth category is for you if you have marketing expertise, connections to other projects, or other skills that can help grow the community and attract people of diverse backgrounds and skill sets. If you're interested in being an ambassador, moderator, or translator, the Community category is a great fit. And if you're a skilled graphic designer, videographer, writer, or social media expert, the Creative category is the perfect place to showcase your talents.

If this sounds like something you are interested in, there is a [formal application process](https://my.ergoport.dev/sigcan_form.html) for becoming a Sigmanaut.

Once accepted into the Sigmanauts Program as a SigCAN (Sigmanaut Candidate), you'll have the opportunity to work with a team of like-minded individuals to showcase your skills and make a meaningful impact on the Ergo ecosystem. Over time, you'll have the chance to become a full-fledged Sigmanaut and take on even greater responsibility within the community.

Join the Sigmanauts Program today and be part of the grassroots finance revolution. Let's build a future where everyone has the power to control their financial destiny.
