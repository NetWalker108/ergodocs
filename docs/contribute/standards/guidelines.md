# Community Guidelines


- Respect other members of the community. Hate speech and personal attacks will not be tolerated
- Be open to different perspectives and opinions. This community values free speech, and members should be prepared to encounter and engage with ideas they may not agree with.
- Be open to constructive criticism. The community is here to learn and grow, so be open to constructively receiving feedback and criticism.
- Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.
- Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticise. Assume good faith. Please do not use Ergo chats for a political or ideological battle, and that tramples curiosity. 
- No spamming or self-promotion. Do not post links or promotional material for your projects or business without permission from the community moderators.
- Be mindful of the legal implications of your actions. 
- Do not share fake news or misinformation. Misinformation can be harmful, so please verify the information before sharing it with the community.
- Do not engage in price manipulation. Do not make posts or engage in activities intended to manipulate the price of any crypto-related asset.
- Any level of scamming will not be tolerated and will be reported to the relevant authorities if necessary.
- Be aware of the risk of hacking and phishing scams. Never share your private keys or personal information with anyone.
- Be aware of your security. Keep your device and accounts secure, and be cautious when clicking on links or downloading files from unknown sources.
- Have fun and enjoy the community! This community allows you to express your ideas freely and connect with others who share your interests.
- The community moderators reserve the right to remove content and/or ban members who consistently violate these guidelines.
- The community moderators may make exceptions to these guidelines in cases where it is deemed necessary to maintain the safety and well-being of the community.
