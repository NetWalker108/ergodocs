# Roles


While the Ergo Foundation occasionally advertises full-time roles, these are usually specialised senior positions. The quickest way to get involved is to start completing some (paid) [bounties](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/) or get involved in the ecosystem chats and see where you can help out!
