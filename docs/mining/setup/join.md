# Start Mining


1. You’ll need a computer with at least one GPU with more than 4Gb memory. 
2. You’ll need to figure out what operating system will be best for you. 
      1. Windows or Linux if you need a desktop and it’s your main PC, or you can go with a mining os like HiveOS or MinerstatOS if it’s going to be a dedicated mining rig.
3. You’ll need to pick [mining software.](#software).
      1. NB miner, lol miner, Trex miner, team red miner are all popular options, but pick one that works best with your set-up. (Team red miner for AMD) 
4. Then you’ll need to pick a [mining pool](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo). Choose one that is smaller if you care about keeping ergo decentralised. 
5. [Wallets](wallet.md)
6. Overclocking


## Getting Started

Search your card here on the [Autolykos v2 hashrates spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NsuoDB27EwCo_BlSjCP3GMLfTSJRPIWIBsL-wPTllUg) to find your estimated hashrate.

There are various pools available as seen on [miningpoolstats.stream/ergo](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo)

## Miners

You can use multiple miners to mine Ergo (Autolykos2). Below you will find a list of mining software used to mine ERG. There are various opinions on which mining software is best, and some are clear winners. The best advice is to try them all and see what works best for you.

In addition to dedicated mining software, there are also Mining OS or operating systems such as HiveOS, one of the more popular options. This allows you to control your rig through dedicated software that will assist with connecting to pools, OC settings, and miners or mining software. These would be considered an all in one package, whereas using a specific miner may require other resources or plugins.
