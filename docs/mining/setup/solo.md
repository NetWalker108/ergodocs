# Solo Mining

Firstly, check out this [calculator](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBFv3mxpu5Erv55zvfFuIo2NnaWht3cc70xZoRo-3c58Cv0A/viewform) if you're not sure if you should be solo mining.

You can solo mine on any [pool that offers a solo port](https://miningpoolstats.com/ergo). Otherwise, you will essentially need to [host your own pool](pool.md).
