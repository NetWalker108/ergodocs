# Solo Mining

You can solo mine on any pool that offers a solo port. Otherwise, you will essentially need to host your own pool.

Firstly, check out this [calculator](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBFv3mxpu5Erv55zvfFuIo2NnaWht3cc70xZoRo-3c58Cv0A/viewform) if you're not sure if you should be solo mining.

There is now a solo-mining smart subpool on [getblok](https://www.getblok.io/smartpools/). Alternatively 2Miners, solopool.org and others offer Solo mining. 



## Getting Started

To solo mine you will need one of the following depending on your setup. 

- [Autolykos2_NV_Miner](https://https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_NV_Miner)
- [Autolykos2_AMD_Miner](https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_AMD_Miner)

You may or may not need to use Stratum Server and Stratum Proxy to operate them. These two projects are here:

- [ErgoStratumServer](https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumServer)
- [ErgoStratumProxy](https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumProxy)

To be able to spend any ERG mined this way, you will need to add this to your `.config`

```
ergo {
  wallet {
    checkEIP27 = true
  }
}
```
