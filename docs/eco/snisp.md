# SNISP

**SNISPs** are *Succinct, Non-Interactive Share Proofs* which will allow for **accurate and efficient calculations of performed work on the blockchain**. 

These proofs can be applied to any PoW blockchain. They should allow for the creation of decentralised mining pools with better security assumptions than alternatives like P2Pool, and better scalability than ETH-based SmartPools. They may also be used for other applications which involve measuring performed work (such as direct work-based governance, work-backed assets, etc)
