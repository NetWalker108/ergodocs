# Sigma'O


- The goal of the project is to provide a smart contract allowing to issue tokens behaving like an option.
- The option type can be CALL or PUT with European or American style.
- The underlying token needs an Oracle that provides the current price of the token in nanoERG.
- The contract is permission less and fully hedged
- A configurable fee for the UI provider is available
