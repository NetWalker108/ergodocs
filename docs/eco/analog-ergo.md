# Analog Ergo

This project aims to use cryptographic primitives (well established, low level algorithms) as the basis for a cross-chain peer-to-peer marketplace. It will enable users to set and agree to listing prices and other parameters in a private and fungible manner, without the involvement of intermediaries.

Update: Commendable progress has been made towards creating a decentralized atomic order book on Ergo. Proof of concept Solidity contracts have been successfully tested. Initial ErgoScript implementation looks promising with testnet transactions having been completed, and contracts currently needing updated to reflect elliptic curve differences between Solidity and ErgoScript.
