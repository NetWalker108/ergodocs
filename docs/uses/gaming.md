### BlitzTCG

Blitz breaks free from traditional TCG factors through a few key traits: allowing players access to their entire deck, implementing a chess-like time bank system, and adding NPC alternatives to the game board.

Our goal is to create a digital TCG that mixes iconic aspects from several game genres together to create
a refreshing alternative to standard TCG gameplay

## NFT-Based Games

### Monster Pub Brawl

Alcohol is an exceptionally rare resource capable of enhancing the monsters who use them with untold power. The raw materials to produce it are found in extremely hostile territories, and only the most skilled of alchemists are able to distill these materials into a potable concoction.

Because of the difficulties  associated with acquiring  alcohol, most people in search sign up for the annual Monster Pub Crawl where contestants take part in a series of battles across the regions for glory, booze, and a spot in the inner circle.Â
