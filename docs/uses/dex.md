# DEX

Until 2020 DeFi Summer, Value Locked in DeFi ([TVL](https://medium.com/coinmonks/google-sheets-analytics-total-value-locked-in-defi-33b926c18a9f)) was too low to use the platforms effectively. After an increasing interest and new token issuance every day, Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) came into the sunlight. Their benefits are for people who don’t want to give up the custody of their funds. DEXes democratized the exchange experience for both blockchain developers and crypto investors. 

## ErgoDex
[ErgoDEX](https://ergodex.io) can provide more functions than Ethereum based DEXes. ErgoDEX [has more properties](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-06-ergodex-model-amm-and-order-book-type-exchange/) such as limit orders, partial filling, and buy-back supports. Ergo’s Multi-Stage Contracts allows for timed release payments, so a code implemented in the contract can help investors to cancel their order with a minimal loss if the developers of the project don’t deliver their promises. With the implementation of NIPoPoWs, DEX will be interoperable in both PoS and PoW blockchains. Users can enjoy the freedom of exchanges with self-custodial wallets.
