# Rosen Bridge

[Rosen Bridge](https://github.com/orgs/rosen-bridge/) is an ergocentric bridge currently [beta testing](https://soft.rosen.tech) itâ€™s first bridge to Cardano. 

Rosen Bridge enables sending and receiving coins and tokens between Ergo and any other blockchain with supporting multi-signature transactions or threshold signatures.

There is no need to utilize smart contracts on the other chains since the consensus on any action can be performed on Ergo. This acts as an inherent security feature, making cross chain transactions significantly more resilient to attempted exploits and bad actor attacks.
