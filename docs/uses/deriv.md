# Derivatives

In crypto, traders can monetise through various strategies such as options or futures leveraged contracts. Centralised exchanges typically provide these tools, but these exchanges can harm traders as they can become like casinos. In decentralised finance, there are alternative platforms for derivatives trading, such as Synthetix for leveraged assets trading and Hegic for options trading via smart contracts. We can also build these protocols on Ergo thanks to Multi-Stage Contracts.
