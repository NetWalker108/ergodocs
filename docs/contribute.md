# Contributing


## Who can contribute?

Ergo operates an open model where contributions from all are welcomed. 

***'Let's create grassroots finance!'***


## How can I contribute as a developer?

There are paid bounties scattered across the Ergo repositories, which are summarised [here](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/). Notably, there are active bounties for [Tutorials and Guides for developers](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/15) at any skill level. 

Anything educative for the community is subject to some bounty, even if not specifically listed. 

Join the [Ergo Discord](https://discord.gg/nr4JRnhAyV) (and enable the development channels) for any support, queries or comments. 

You can submit any **payment requests** for bounties completed [here](https://q9fwzopidh8.typeform.com/to/G5gAKC4r).

### Are you looking for full-time developers?

While the Ergo Foundation occasionally advertises full-time roles, these are usually specialised senior positions. The quickest way to get involved is to start completing some (paid) [bounties](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/) or get involved in the ecosystem chats and see where you can help out!


### How can I submit a grant request? 

We recommend that your initial step should be to start a [Raffle](https://ergoraffle.com/). A Raffle provides a clear funding goal, shows community support - and can be topped up by grant/foundation funding. 

There are several grant programmes available for larger-scale projects. Submit a grant request directly to the [Good Whale Fund](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/13), [DarkFund0](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/1) - or email us directly at the [team@ergoplatform.org](mailto:team@ergoplatform.org).

### Are you looking for regional managers? 

If you're interested in starting a regional branch - this can involve running regional chats, hosting meet-ups, etc. 

Check [our chats](https://linktr.ee/ergoplatform) to ensure a branch doesn't already exist for your region. 

While there are several paid community managers within the ergo ecosystem, they are usually promoted from within. If this is somewhere you excel, get involved with the ecosystem, keep on top of new products launching and make yourself useful in a budding project. 



## How is Ergo Funded?
