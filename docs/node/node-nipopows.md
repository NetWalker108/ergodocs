# NiPoPoWS

## Bootstrapping

This makes it possible to get a verified UTXO set snapshot without checking ~95% of the blockchain.

Then bootstrapping with NiPoPoWs will be done. Hopefully in Q1 2023, we will see a release with UTXO set snapshots + NiPoPoWs bootstrapping, giving fullnode security with bootstrapping in ~30-60 mins on ordinary laptop.

Most of full nodes will provide snapshots. Security is theoretically the same as for full node
