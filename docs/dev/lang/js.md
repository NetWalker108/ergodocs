# Javascript

[Dappstep Docs](https://www.dappstep.com/) include many practical examples with Javascript and Nodejs that will help you to understand to implement different aspects of dapp functionality on Ergo


## Ergo JS Template

The Ergo JS Template aims to serve as an entry point to Ergo dApp Development

Bootstrapped with Create React App. It contains ergo-ts and ergo-lib libraries as dependencies and some examples of how to use these libraries.

The following examples can be seen on the [Ergo JS Template](https://github.com/anon-real/ergo-js-template) repository

- Interacting with the explorer
- Encoding different data types
- Decoding fields (registers) of tokens
