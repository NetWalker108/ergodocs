# Scala

Ergo's primary language is [Scala](https://www.udemy.com/course/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners/). Similarily, the scripting language used by ergo, *[ergoscript](ergoscript.md)*, is similarly based on Scala.

This [Ergo Scala Skeleton App](https://github.com/dav009/ergo-scala-skeleton-app) is a great place to start.
