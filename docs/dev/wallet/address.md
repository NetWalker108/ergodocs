# Addresses

Addresses are short strings that correspond to specific scripts and are used to protect a [box](../data-model/box)

Unlike a (hex-encoded) binary representation of a script, an Ergo address use a `Base58-encoding` and therefore has some advantageous characteristics which the binary representation does not offer:

* We can quickly check the integrity of an address via an integrated checksum (which is a "small-sized datum derived from a block of digital data to detect errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage" according to Wikipedia).
* A prefix of the address shows you the network and address type. In particular, the network prefix prevents you from mistakenly sending mainnet tokens to the testnet address.
* The address uses an encoding (namely, Base58 as mentioned) that avoids similarly-looking characters and is friendly to double-clicking and line-breaking in emails.
* An address encodes network type, address type, checksum, and enough information to correspond with particular scripts.

Let's look at the prefix byte, which contains information about the network and address types:

## Possible Types

Possible network types are:

* Mainnet - `0x00`
* Testnet - `0x10`

Address types are (semantics described below):

* `0x01` - Pay-to-PublicKey(P2PK) address
* `0x02` - Pay-to-Script-Hash(P2SH)
* `0x03` - Pay-to-Script(P2S)


For an address type, we form content bytes as follows:

* **P2PK** - serialized (compressed) public key
* **P2SH** - first 192 bits of the Blake2b256 hash of serialized script bytes
* **P2S**  - serialized script (this is where mining rewards go!)

For example, sending 10 Ergs to a P2PK address usually means that a corresponding transaction will contain a box in which 10 Ergs are locked by a public key encoded in the P2PK address. Similarly,
in the case of a P2S address, the box will be locked by a script encoded in the address. In the most complicated case of a P2SH script, the box will be protected by a special predefined script that takes the first 192 bits of Blake2b256 hash value for a script shown by an input spending the box. 


Here is an example of how particular addresses are going to look on the testnet: 

* **P2PK** (`3WvsT2Gm4EpsM9Pg18PdY6XyhNNMqXDsvJTbbf6ihLvAmSb7u5RN`)
* **P2SH** (`rbcrmKEYduUvADj9Ts3dSVSG27h54pgrq5fPuwB`)
* **P2S** (`Ms7smJwLGbUAjuWQ`)

And here is how what they look like on the mainnet:

* **P2PK** (`9fRAWhdxEsTcdb8PhGNrZfwqa65zfkuYHAMmkQLcic1gdLSV5vA`)
* **P2SH** (`8UApt8czfFVuTgQmMwtsRBZ4nfWquNiSwCWUjMg`)
* **P2S** (`4MQyML64GnzMxZgm, BxKBaHkvrTvLZrDcZjcsxsF7aSsrN73ijeFZXtbj4CXZHHcvBtqSxQ`)

## Summary

* **Prefix byte** = `network type + address type` (for example, P2S script on the testnet starts with 0x13 before Base58)
* **checksum** = `leftmost_4_bytes (blake2b256 (prefix byte || content bytes))`
* **address** = `prefix byte || content bytes || checksum`
