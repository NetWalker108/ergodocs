# Developers

This page provides a general entry-point to Ergo development. 

> Join us on [discord](https://discord.gg/7kWWQeMCwe) if you get stuck!


## Getting Started

- Make sure to familiarise yourself with the Ergo [protocol](/dev/protocol) and the [eUTXO](eutxo.md) model.  
- You communicate with the blockchain via a locally run instance of the Ergo [Node](/node/install). 
- The node provides an [API](resources.md#api) that is used by your SDK logic to carry out operations on the blockchain. 

> The **on-chain**  code is [ErgoScript](ergoscript.md), the ***off-chain*** code can be done in a programming langage of your choice. 

## Languages



- [Start coding in JVM (Scala/Java)](/dev/stack/appkit/)
- [Start coding in Rust](/dev/Languages/rust)
- [Start coding in Python](/dev/Languages/python)
- [Start coding in JavaScript](js.md)
- [Start coding in JSON](/dev/stack/jde)
- [Start coding in ErgoScript](scs/ergoscript/)

## Tutorials

- For your first interaction with the Ergo blockchain, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5s-XV6-Hs) takes you through the steps to programmatically create & submit a transaction.
