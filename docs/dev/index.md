# Developers

This page should provides an entry-point to Ergo development. For a high-level introduction to Ergo please see the [protocol page](/dev/protocol). For a list of tools and services see [resources](resources.md) page.

## Getting Started


Your application will communicate with the blockchain via a locally run instance of the Ergo Node. The Node provides an API that is used by your SDK logic to carry out operations on the blockchain. The on-chain code is ErgoScript, the off-chain code can be done in a programming langage of your choice. 

- [Set up a local Node on mainnet or testnet](/node/)

For your first interaction with the Ergo blockchain, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5s-XV6-Hs) takes you through the steps to programmatically create & submit a transaction. Alternatively, dive straight into ErgoScript or any of the other paths laid out below. 

Make sure to check out the [Resources page](dev/start/resources/) and [dev-tools tab on sigmaverse.io](https://sigmaverse.io/)
