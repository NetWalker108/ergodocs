As Kotlin is (mainly) a JVM language, refer to [AppKit](appkit.md).

[Mosaik](intro.md) does also provide a [Kotlin DSL](tutorial2.md) to describe UIs.

[Ergo Wallet app](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app) is written in Kotlin and can serve as an example how to handle Appkit in Kotlin.
