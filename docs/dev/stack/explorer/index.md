## Toolkits

- [Ergo Nix Toolkit](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-nix) provides Nix derivations for packages and services on Ergo.
- [Ergo Bootstrap](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-bootstrap), built on top of ergo-nix, will help you to quickly deploy an Ergo blockchain cluster with a handful of useful tools you might need to start developing your dApps.
- [ergo-setup](https://github.com/abchrisxyz/ergo-setup) is a Docker based Ergo setup (Node, Explorer & GraphQL). Somewhat similar to Ergo Bootstrap except it offers much less options and is not NixOS-based.
