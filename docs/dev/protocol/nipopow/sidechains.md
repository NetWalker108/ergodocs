## Sidechains

Another implementation is cross-chain communication with Proof of Stake networks. PoS networks such as Cardano can interact with Ergo through NIPoPoW integration. Such verification schemes can erase the need for centralised DAO structures and create new non-interactive cross-chain operations. 

To put it simply, NIPoPoWs act as sidechains. Two or more separate chains can integrate through NIPoPoWs without the need for change in other chains. Such integration would erase the need for, for example, "Wrapped Tokens," tokens that rely on DAO governance. 

NIPoPoW is a robust tool in creating blockchain networks and provides easier client access. They're also helpful in enhancing scalability by creating Layer 2 organisations. 



**Side chains**, on the other hand, are a completely different component of blockchain. They are beneficial for various elements such as private chains, scalability improvement, and cross-chain interoperability. [Kushti mentioned](https://youtu.be/QCMpVRVrHqI) that he will release a sidechain "cookbook," entitled Ergo-Meta, in the following months. 



One application of NIPoPoWs that we have described in a previous article deals with [logarithmic space mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s05ypkSC7gk). Logarithmic space mining allows for "light miners." Like light clients, light miners can bootstrap with block headers without downloading the whole blockchain. It is also possible to store just a few necessary blocks to verify the whole blockchain in a blockchain. This essentially eradicates the need for miners to store all of the blockchains. Integrating logarithmic space mining in Ergo is possible via velvet (soft) forks, therefore preventing the need for painful hard forks.



Another application of NIPoPoWs was proposed in the first [ErgoHack](https://curiaregiscrypto.medium.com/ergohack-results-f7d72711a9db) by a team called SmartPools. SmartPools' proposal aims to increase the **Nakamoto Coefficient**, a metric for calculating the decentralisation of the given network. In our case, the proposal aims to increase the decentralisation of the Ergo Platform by bootstrapping mining entities with collateralised smart contracts. The purpose here is to provide returns for non-miner investors and prevent big GPU farms from taking control of the system.



The most well-known example of NIPoPoWs is the implementation of the second layer blockchain. Second layers help interact with different blockchains by increasing scalability and creating private sidechains for enterprise-grade applications. Second layers create blockchains on top of the primary blockchain for different use cases. Because transactions can happen on these second layers without constant synchronous updates, we can lower the network load substantially by keeping everything on the main chain all the time.

**The Ergo blockchain has supported NIPoPoWs since its genesis, yet their use cases are still in their infancy. We continue to develop this field of research with our partners at [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) and [EMURGO](https://emurgo.io/), and we expect their application to increase with continued contributions from the community developers.**
