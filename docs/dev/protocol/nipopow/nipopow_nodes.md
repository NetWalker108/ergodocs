# Light Clients

**Light Clients** are essential when considering the hurdles cryptocurrency faces with mass adoption. Most crypto users do not have the necessary tools to run a full node. Running a full node means having a strong processor, electricity costs, and potentially hundreds of gigabytes of memory to store the entire blockchain. 

NIPoPoWs enable Ergo to build a mobile [SPV](spv.md) client that only needs around 100KB of block headers to be downloaded. Verifying whether a transaction happened on the blockchain becomes simplified, enabling users to interact with the blockchain using more efficient and convenient mobile wallets.
