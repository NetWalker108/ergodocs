# Simplified Payment Verification 

A full Bitcoin node checks all the blocks in the blockchain (using headers) and ensures there are no fraudulent transactions. It's a very secure way of using crypto â€“ but there's a problem. It requires significant bandwidth, storage, and processing power. That commodity hardware is expensive and using a full node to validate and make transactions is unsuitable for mobile devices. This is particularly true for Bitcoin, where the blockchain is over [270 GB and counting](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/blocks-size).

Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) is designed to address this problem, as described in the [Bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf):

> It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks are added after it confirms the network has accepted it.
 
Satoshi notes that this is not a perfect solution and is vulnerable to an attacker overpowering the network and fooling SPV users.

Moreover, while SPV mode is intended for resource-limited devices, this 'lite' approach is not always feasible. Ethereum's headers alone total around 5 GB to download. Thus Ethereum mobile clients do not validate chain validity and blindly have to trust third parties.

There are proposals to reduce the requirements for SPV mode by checking just a few random headers instead of all of them. But it takes a lot of work to do that securely. 



## Efficient SPV

Several years have been spent researching and developing secure protocols for efficient SPV clients. The two best-known and most reliable protocols are NIPoPoWs and FlyClient.

Ergo implements NIPoPoWs, or Non-interactive Proof-of-Proof-of-Work. 

> *Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) are short stand-alone strings that a computer program can inspect to verify that an event happened on a proof-of-work-based blockchain without connecting to the blockchain network and without downloading all block headers. For example, these proofs can illustrate that a cryptocurrency payment was made.*

NIPoPoWs allow very efficient mobile wallets to be created. [SPV wallets](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#simplified-payment-verification-spv) are already very lightweight compared to full nodes because they only require the download of block headers, not the whole blockchain. NIPoPoW wallets need to download only a tiny ***sample*** of block headers, around 250, when SPV clients need to download half a million block headers. The sample needed changes but doesn't grow much in size as the blockchain grows more extensive, even after accumulated decades of data.

This enables us to build a mobile SPV client that requires around **just 100KB** of block headers to be downloaded.

A super-efficient Ergo wallet with SPV security is in development, so stay tuned for more updates!
