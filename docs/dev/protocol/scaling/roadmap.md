# Scaling Roadmap


## Roadmap (Dec 2021)

[Ergo protocol research and client development roadmap (Dec, 2021)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/qfjhw4/ergo_protocol_research_and_client_development/)

> We are researching different scalability proposals for Bitcoin, Cardano, and Ethereum, such as sidechains (which are also nice for testing new features), commit chains, rollups, isomorphic state channels, FairSwap etc. New opcodes are needed for some solutions for Bitcoin (so a little chance to see things in the real world), while Ergo allows for such constructions with no forks. Ergo will not just be a chain but a king of chains (which will improve the cryptoeconomic security of the protocol as miners will get additional rewards from sidechains).

> for improving the performance of the network, the reference protocol client (Ergo node) is getting different performance improvements in the p2p layer and not only right now

> bootstrapping via UTXO set snapshot and NIPoPoWs are in progress now. This should allow a client to have much faster bootstrapping without compromising security.

> 5.0 soft-fork is going to be proposed to miners soon; the main change is about switching to just-in-time-costing in ErgoTree evaluation which is giving a 5-6x boost in scripts processing (on real blockchain data)

> time to consider long-term cryptoeconomic security of the protocol; discussions have already started: https://www.ergoforum.org/t/ergo-emission-details-retargeting-via-a-soft-fork/2778/7

> for application development, more frameworks and ready apps are needed; there are some results to be announced already

> Plans for supporting the different application is out of the scope of this text and would be a topic of another piece.
