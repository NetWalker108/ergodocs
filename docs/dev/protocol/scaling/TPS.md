## Transaction Speed

Transaction speed is commonly measured in Transactions per Block/Second (TPS). Transaction speed, specifically TPS, measures the transactions per block/second a blockchain can perform, quantifying how quickly a blockchain can complete transactions.  

Below are approximated TPS values for other blockchains:

* `BTC - ~7 TPS (Gobbel, 2017).`
* `ETH - ~15 TPS (Clincy et al (table1), 2019)`
* `XRP - ~ 1500 TPS (Clincy et al (table1), 2019)`
* `ADA - ~ ~7 TPS (~250 in controlled tests) (Stamoulis, 2021).`
* `DOT - ~1500 TPS (Hiemstra et al., 2021)`


It is important to remember that TPS (Transactions Per Second) is a vanity metric, and it is not about how many transactions you can do but rather the weight of those transactions and the computational cost limit per block. This cost limit depends on the hardware miners have, the size of the network, and other dynamic factors, but focusing on how many simple transactions you can do at once is meaningless, especially on Ergo. 


With the release of v5, the raw TPS numbers should bring us to around **47.5tx/s** - improvements on top of this are still possible. The focus is on raising the TPS without compromising classic blockchain assumptions and guarantees.
