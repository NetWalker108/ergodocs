# Smart Contracts

Ergo extends Bitcoin's way of writing contracts by attaching a guard script (together with additional custom data) to every coin. For example, in addition to regular protection by some `m‐of‐n` signature, Ergo allows specifying the possible recipients of these coins, which may be another contract with similar complex conditions. **This "chaining" approach allows the implementation of secure and efficient contracts of arbitrary complexity.** Keeping all this in mind, we expect ErgoScript and Ergo's design to be uniquely useful as Contractual Money. 

The [ErgoScript](ergoscript.md) page provides an overview of all resources related to smart contract development, or dive straight into the [ErgoScript Primer](ergoscript-primer.md).
