# Ergo Puppet

[ergo-puppet](https://github.com/dav009/ergo-puppet) is an upgrade on the [ergo playground](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-playgrounds). It lets you play and unit test Ergo contracts offchain. Puppet uses as much of AppKit as possible, meaning you should be able to test your code with Puppet with no changes.
