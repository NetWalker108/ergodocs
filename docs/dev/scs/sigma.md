# Sigma Protocols



Ergo aims to provide an efficient, secure, and easy way to implement financial contracts that will be useful and survivable in the long term. Ergo has plenty of uniqueness, but the most significant is probably **Sigma protocols**. These allow a true P2P system with privacy in mind. No one else at the moment can build a trustless LETS system, multisig with no signers disclosure, trustless payment networks or has real ring signatures that preserve zero knowledge.

> Privacy must remain an option to protect the individual. It does not have to be forced; let people make their own choices. Privacy is the ability to create barriers and erect boundaries to create a space for the individual. It is up to each what borders and boundaries they choose to make. - *The Ergo Manifesto*

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Ergo provides superior access to ***discrete log-based* zero-knowledge proofs**, but what exactly is a zero-knowledge proof? 

Let's say someone picks up a phone in a bar. You can prove it's yours by hiding the screen, entering the unlock code and showing the unlocked screen to the person who found it. This scenario is a simple example of zero-knowledge proof: you have proven you own the phone without revealing any sensitive information.

In cryptography, most practical problems are associated with secrets. The most popular application lies in digital signatures, used by millions of people worldwide every day. Essentially, these involve saying: 

> *' This message proves I know the private key associated with this public key – but I'm not revealing the private key itself'.*


##  Sigma protocols

ErgoScript is the language used to specify the conditions under which currency can be spent. The language supports a type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs called Σ-protocols and is flexible enough to allow for ring-signatures, multi signatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computation.

The overwhelming majority of successful public blockchain use‐cases are related to financial applications. Ergo extends Bitcoin's way of writing contracts by attaching a guard script (together with additional custom data) to every coin. For example, in addition to regular protection by some `m‐of‐n` signature, Ergo allows specifying the possible recipients of these coins, which may be another contract with similar complex conditions. This **"chaining"** approach allows the implementation of secure and efficient contracts of arbitrary complexity. Keeping all this in mind, we expect ErgoScript and Ergo's design to be uniquely useful as Contractual Money.

Let's say you want to create a 'ring spending contract', where either of us can make a transaction from the same address, but we don't want anyone else to know which one of us is spending the funds. That's not possible with Bitcoin, and while Ethereum can, it would be expensive and complicated – especially with a ring size of 10 or 20 members, required for robust privacy.

With Ergo, this kind of application can be created quickly, thanks to integrating Sigma protocols in the core and enabling **self-sovereign application-level privacy**: trustless scripts that can be used to access mixers or other functionality without any third parties required.

```scala
val ringScript = s"""
{
atLeast(
  3, 
  Coll(
    PK("9f8ZQt1Sue6W5ACdMSPRzsHj3jjiZkbYy3CEtB4BisxEyk4RsNk"), 
    PK("9hFWPyhCJcw4KQyCGu4yAGfC1ieRAKyFg24FKjLJK2uDgA873uq"), 
    PK("9fdVP2jca1e5nCTT6q9ijZLssGj6v4juY8gEAxUhp7YTuSsLspS"), 
    PK("9gAKeRu1W4Dh6adWXnnYmfqjCTnxnSMtym2LPPMPErCkusCd6F3"),
    PK("9gmNsqrqdSppLUBqg2UzREmmivgqh1r3jmNcLAc53hk3YCvAGWE")
  )
)
}
```

This is an example `3-out-of-5` **threshold signature** which can be compiled to a `P2S` address, sending ergs to the [resulting address](https://wallet.plutomonkey.com/p2s/?source=ewphdExlYXN0KAogIDMsIAogIENvbGwoCiAgICBQSygiOWY4WlF0MVN1ZTZXNUFDZE1TUFJ6c0hqM2pqaVprYll5M0NFdEI0QmlzeEV5azRSc05rIiksIAogICAgUEsoIjloRldQeWhDSmN3NEtReUNHdTR5QUdmQzFpZVJBS3lGZzI0RktqTEpLMnVEZ0E4NzN1cSIpLCAKICAgIFBLKCI5ZmRWUDJqY2ExZTVuQ1RUNnE5aWpaTHNzR2o2djRqdVk4Z0VBeFVocDdZVHVTc0xzcFMiKSwgCiAgICBQSygiOWdBS2VSdTFXNERoNmFkV1hublltZnFqQ1RueG5TTXR5bTJMUFBNUEVyQ2t1c0NkNkYzIiksCiAgICBQSygiOWdtTnNxcnFkU3BwTFVCcWcyVXpSRW1taXZncWgxcjNqbU5jTEFjNTNoazNZQ3ZBR1dFIikKICApCikKfQ==) (protected by the threshold sig).

Here is a good introduction to [making a signature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daP67yp-Czs&list=PLUWruihtE-HtL-JZk8Vb4Yn_H18aE3rb6&index=4).


## 'Optional' Privacy?

A rich smart-contract language is a priority in Ergo, and with non-optional privacy, you can't have (efficient) powerful contracts. Even more, for simple payments, formalising leakage is hard, and for arbitrary contracts simply not feasible.

There are also plenty of reasons someone might want optional privacy - transparent ledgers are a feature for many use-cases. e.g. charities that want everyone to have full access to the flow of funds.  

There are also strong arguments for optional privacy for adoption and regulation. ErgoMixer is non-interactive, so it works with the blockchain alone; no off-chain coordination with others (and trusted coordinator) is needed.

In future, the community could elect to enable privacy by default for every transaction in Ergo. Or maybe we'll see integrations mix-nets and other novel ideas on the application layer.  


## Use Cases

These composable proofs enable some very strong use cases when combined with a blockchain. The logic for proofs can include conditions based on blockchain state. For example, 'If the deadline block height has been reached, Alice can provide knowledge of a secret key for a refund. OR a ring signature from Alice and Bob is required to spend coins.' Or 'If this account holds a minimum of 100 ERG, Alice OR Bob can remove funds above that amount.'

It's relatively easy to swap coins or custom tokens trustlessly across any Bitcoin-like blockchains. But beyond that, Ergo allows partial swaps. Like on a regular exchange, we can partially fill orders and enable a fully-fledged decentralised exchange (DEX) that enables cross-chain trading: a trustless version of existing crypto exchanges. There's no need for any gateways, token wrapping or other potential bottlenecks or points of failure.
