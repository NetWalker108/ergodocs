The [sigmastate-interpreter](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter#sigma-language-background.md) repository contains implementations of ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree Interpreter for a family of Sigma-protocol based authentication languages (or simply [*Sigma Language*](sigma-lang.md)).

This library is used internally in the [Ergo Node](install.md) and [ergo-wallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/tree/master/ergo-wallet).

A better alternative for developing Ergo applications using JVM languages is [AppKit](appkit.md), a thin wrapper around core components provided by the ErgoScript interpreter and Ergo protocol implementations written in Scala.
