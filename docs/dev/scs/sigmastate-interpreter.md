This repository contains implementations of ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree
Interpreter for a family of Sigma-protocol based authentication languages (or simply
Sigma language).

This library is used internally in [Ergo Node](node.md) and [ergo-wallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/tree/master/ergo-wallet), the public interfaces are subject to change.

For development of Ergo applications using JVM languages (Java/Scala/Kotlin/etc) a better alternative is to use [appkit](appkit.md)
